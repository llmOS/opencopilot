This project moves fast and breaks often. As a consequence, any proposed change may become out of date very quickly!

We'd love to see your contribution, but for the aforementioned reason, create an issue with a proposed change, so we can discuss it there and make sure your contribution makes it to the main repo.

Please also feel free to report bugs and request features in the issues section.
