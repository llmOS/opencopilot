In this directory, we showcase a curated collection of sample projects that demonstrate the diverse functionalities of OpenCopilot. Below is a brief overview of each:

- **[aws_copilot](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/examples/aws_copilot)**: This copilot serves as an interactive Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLI documentation. It assists developers with AWS CLI, offering valuable insights and answers throughout their journey.

- **[coding_copilot](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/examples/coding_copilot)**: A specialized copilot that crafts code to address coding challenges, ensuring that solutions meet constraints and pass provided test cases. This uses the CodeLlama engine. Detailed [setup instructions](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/blob/main/examples/coding_copilot/README.md) are available.

- **[intent_router](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/examples/intent_router)**: An example showcasing the prompt_builder's capability. It dynamically constructs custom prompts based on detected user intent.

- **[docker_deployment](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/examples/docker_deployment)**: A practical guide detailing the deployment of an OpenCopilot project within a docker container.

- **[llm_copilot](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/examples/llm_copilot)**: An interactive Large Language Model (LLM) Copilot designed to guide users through OpenCopilot's developer documentation, ensuring they find the right information and insights.

- **[oss_copilot](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/examples/oss_copilot)**: Similar to the llm_copilot but leverages the open-source OSS LLama-2 model instead of proprietary OpenAI models. Check the [README](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/blob/main/examples/oss_copilot/README.md) for setup guidelines.

- **[ready_player_me_copilot](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/examples/ready_player_me_copilot)**: This copilot is an interactive guide for Ready Player Me (RPM) developer documentation. It assists developers working with RPM by providing timely insights and answers.
